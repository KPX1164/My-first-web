                <p>Why Software Engineering</p>
                <p>Let me tell you something about my life, It all started when I was going to buy one thing, the phone, I did a lot of research in order to get the most value out of it. With it Talk to me, buy a mobile phone model.After that, I don't change my phone often, so I get myself a question.And the answer to that It is due to the stability of the well-developed software. I wondered why my previous phone didn't look like this, so I started to explore technologies. That was my starting point.And that made me think of the impossible and that I would have to accomplish it someday of my life.
                </p>
                <p>Impossible, it builds on my inspiration. "Impossible is my favorite starting point."</p>
